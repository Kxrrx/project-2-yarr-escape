# Yarr Escape
Yarr Escape is a fast-paced 3D puzzle action game where the player controls a pirate who is
trying to escape from jail using an escape route that goes through a tortuous underground
passage filled with traps and obstacles. At the end of the escape route is a port, where an
escape sloop is waiting for him. The player wins if he/she manages to reach the sloop.
